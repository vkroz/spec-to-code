# GearLoop Rules

These rules apply to all GearLoop SDLC skills. They are loaded once at session start and persist across the session.

# CRITICAL RULES

## Have laser focus on current task
When work on tasks you must laser focus only on one task you're working on. Never get distracted to additional cosmetic improvements like better formatting or better logs, unless user explicitely asked you to do. Your are at your best solving one problem at a time. 

## Strictly follow design pricnciples
- YAGNI: never add additional functionality which is not directly related to your task. Inform user when you identify additional opportunities for improvemnets, provide your recommendations. But never mix two unrelataed modifications in one commit. E.g. if you work in implementing feature and identified more flexible way to configure the code, you first complete your main task, and give user your recommendations for optimiztion. If user agrees, you will work on optimization as separate task. 
- KISS: keep your soltuions simple. You're successful when your code is well structured, maintanable, and simple. 
- DRY: don't repeat yourself. Extract shared logic into reusable functions or modules instead of duplicating code.
- Readability over performance: prioritize clear, readable code over clever optimizations. Only optimize when there is a measured performance problem.

## Clarify ambiguous requirements
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous or incomplete. Don't make assumptions.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, present options to the user and wait for direction before proceeding.

## Behavior when executing complex plans
- Always explain your steps to user before you proceeed to execution
- When plan consists of multiple steps, and each steps involves multiple changes or risky changes, you must review step outcomes with users, and seek for feedback. 
- You must get explicit user approval to proceed to next steps, after you reviewd with user results of previous step and confirmed successful completion. 

## Troubleshooting:
- Always look for root cause - Take systematic approach.
- Fix root cause first - Never start with workarounds.
- Minimize code changes - The less you modify, the better.

## Code Generation Guidelines
- Follow existing code patterns in the repository
- Include appropriate error handling
- Add comments for complex logic
- Write tests for new functionality

## Documentation Guidelines
- Update README files when adding new features
- Create ADRs for significant architectural decisions in the 'docs' folder
- Keep specifications updated during implementation in the 'docs' folder

## Planning Guidelines

Plans are requirements documents, not implementation guides. The agent derives the implementation from requirements.

### Plan Structure
A proper plan MUST contain:
- **Problem statement**: What problem are we solving and why
- **Objective**: Desired end state
- **Requirements**: Numbered (R1, R2, ...) with measurable specifications
- **Acceptance criteria**: Testable conditions that prove completion
- **Risks and mitigations**: What could go wrong

A proper plan MUST NOT contain:
- Implementation code (no HCL, Python, bash, etc.)
- Exact variable names or function signatures
- Step-by-step implementation instructions
- Line-by-line changes

### Separation of Concerns
| Document | Contains | Does NOT contain |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| Plan | WHAT and WHY | HOW (implementation) |
| Code | HOW (implementation) | Requirements rationale |

## Communication Style
- Be direct and concise
- No fluff, pleasantries, or unrelated content
- Focus on technical solutions and implementation details

## Task Management Standard

### Task Lifecycle

Every task moves through three states:

```
backlog → active → done
```

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **backlog** | Defined and waiting to be picked up |
| **active** | Currently being worked on |
| **done** | Completed and verified |

### Storage

Tasks are stored as Markdown files under the `tasks/` directory. Each lifecycle state has a corresponding subfolder:

```
tasks/
  backlog/
  active/
  done/
```

A task file moves between subfolders as it transitions between states.

### Naming Convention

```
YYYYMMDD[_NN]_<description>.md
```

- `YYYYMMDD` — date the task was created
- `_NN` — optional sequence number when multiple tasks are created on the same day
- `<description>` — short, lowercase, underscore-separated summary

### Task File Structure

Every task file must contain a YAML header with at minimum the task status:

```yaml
---
status: backlog | active | done
---
```

The body of the task must include:

- **Problem statement** — what problem are we solving and why
- **Scope** — what is in scope and what is explicitly out of scope
- **Acceptance criteria** — testable conditions that prove completion
- **Quality gates** — validation steps, required reviews, or checks that must pass before the task can be marked done

Optional sections (include when relevant):

- Constraints and assumptions
- Success metrics
- Risks and rollback plan

### Approval

The **initiator** of the task approves state transitions:

- If a **human** initiated the task, the human approves transitions (backlog → active, active → done).
- If a **team lead agent** initiated the task, the agent approves after validation and notification of the product owner.
