# Comment Code

Add meaningful comments to source code without altering its behavior.

## Workflow

1. **Determine scope** — identify what the user wants commented: a specific function, a file, a selection, or a set of files.
2. **Read the code** — understand the logic, control flow, and data structures before writing anything.
3. **Add comments** — apply the rules below, using the correct comment syntax for the language.
4. **Verify** — confirm the code is unchanged aside from added comments. Run linters if available.

## What to Comment

- **Why**, not **what** — explain intent, trade-offs, and constraints the code itself cannot convey.
- Non-obvious algorithms or business logic.
- Assumptions, invariants, and known limitations.
- Important side effects (I/O, mutations, external calls).
- Edge cases and error-handling rationale.
- Public API surface: function/class purpose, parameters, return values.

## What NOT to Comment

- Obvious operations (`i += 1  // increment i`).
- Code that is self-documenting through clear naming.
- Restating the code in English (`// loop through items` above a for-loop).
- Commented-out code — remove dead code instead.
- Change history — that belongs in version control.

## Comment Style

- Use the language's idiomatic comment syntax and doc-comment conventions:
  - Python: `#` inline, `"""docstrings"""` for modules/classes/functions
  - JS/TS: `//` inline, `/** JSDoc */` for exports
  - Go: `//` with godoc conventions
  - Rust: `///` doc-comments, `//` inline
  - Java/Kotlin: `/** Javadoc */` for public API, `//` inline
  - Other languages: follow their standard conventions
- Keep comments concise — one or two sentences per block.
- Place comments on the line above the code they describe, at the same indentation level.
- For multi-line explanations, use a block/doc-comment rather than stacking single-line comments.

## Safety Rules

- NEVER modify code logic, formatting, or structure — only add comments.
- NEVER remove or rewrite existing comments unless they are demonstrably wrong.
- Preserve all original whitespace and line breaks.

## Examples

**Good:**

```python
# Retry with exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming a recovering service
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    wait = base_delay * (2 ** attempt)
    time.sleep(wait)
```

**Bad:**

```python
# Loop from 0 to max_retries
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    # Calculate wait time
    wait = base_delay * (2 ** attempt)
    # Sleep for wait seconds
    time.sleep(wait)
```
