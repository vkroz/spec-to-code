# QA Integration Test (`/gl:qa-integration-test`)

## Purpose
Validate that:
1. **New functionality** delivered in the current scope behaves end-to-end.
2. **Existing functionality** (prior phases or related areas) still works.

## Preconditions
- A runnable app or test environment the project uses (tests, dev server, etc.).
- Enough implementation exists to exercise the scope (otherwise say what is missing).

## Output
Write an **integration test report** (markdown — `docs/` or user-chosen path), including:
- Scope (phase number, task IDs, or "ad-hoc: ...")
- What was executed (commands, URLs, scenarios)
- Pass/fail per scenario
- Regressions found and severity
- Open issues

## Usage
```
/gl:qa-integration-test
```
Optionally scope in the user message: *"phase 2 only"*, *"after defect TASK-xxx"*, etc.

## Workflow

1. Infer scope from context (recent phase, user instruction, or task just completed).

2. Run the project's integration/e2e tests if present; supplement with **manual checks** where needed.

3. Focus on **interfaces between components** and **realistic user paths** for this slice of work.

4. Do not claim release readiness — that is **`/gl:qa-system-test`**.

## Discipline
- Fix failures you can within scope; escalate product decisions.
- Keep the report factual and actionable.
